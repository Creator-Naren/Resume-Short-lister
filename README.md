Resume Shortlisting System
A Python-based resume screening tool that helps shortlist candidates by comparing their skills with a job's required skills. The project reads candidate data from a CSV file, calculates match percentages, ranks candidates, and exports shortlisted results.
Overview
Recruiters often need to scan many resumes against a fixed set of job requirements. This project automates a simple version of that workflow by checking candidate skills against required skills and marking candidates as Selected or Not Selected based on a configurable threshold.
Features
Load multiple candidate resumes from a CSV file
Match candidate skills with required job skills
Calculate match percentage for every candidate
Rank candidates from highest to lowest match
Mark candidates as Selected or Not Selected
Export shortlisted candidates to a CSV file
Support weighted skill matching for priority skills
Run in interactive CLI mode or demo mode
Generate a LinkedIn-ready project report PDF
Tech Stack
Python 3.10+
CSV file handling
Command-line interface with argparse
PDF/report generation with:reportlab
Pillow

CSV Input Format
The input CSV file must contain these columns:
Name,Skills
Alice Johnson,"Python, SQL, Flask, Git, Docker"
Bob Smith,"Java, Spring, SQL, React"
Installation
Clone or download the project, then install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the interactive resume shortlisting system:
python resume_shortlisting_system.py --input sample_resumes.csv
Run the built-in demo:
python resume_shortlisting_system.py --demo
Generate the LinkedIn project report PDF:
python generate_linkedin_pdf.py
Matching Methods
Basic Skill Matching
Basic matching compares each candidate's skills with the required skills and calculates a percentage:
Match Percentage = Matched Required Skills / Total Required Skills * 100
Weighted Skill Matching
Weighted matching lets important skills carry more value. For example:
python:3, sql:2, react:2, docker:1
This is useful when some skills are more important than others for a role.
Sample Demo
The demo uses these required skills:
Python, React, SQL, Docker
Example shortlisted candidates:
Alice Johnson - 75.00%
Carol Lee - 75.00%
Farhan Ali - 75.00%
Selected candidates are exported to:
shortlisted_candidates.csv
Report
A project report PDF is included here:
docs/LinkedIn_Resume_Shortlisting_Project_Report.pdf
It contains a summary of the project, screenshots, charts, and output examples suitable for sharing on LinkedIn or adding to a portfolio.
Future Improvements
Add PDF and DOCX resume parsing
Add a web interface
Store candidate data in a database
Add natural language processing for smarter skill extraction
Support job descriptions as input
Add charts directly in the CLI report workflow
